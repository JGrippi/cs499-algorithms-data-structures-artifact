# Course Advisory System - Graph Algorithm Enhancement

## Overview
This repository contains both the original and enhanced versions of a course advising system developed for CS-300: Data Structures and Algorithms at Southern New Hampshire University. The application implements a Binary Search Tree structure for managing course data, enhanced with sophisticated graph algorithms for prerequisite validation and course sequencing.

## Project Structure
- `/enhanced` - Enhanced version with DFS and Topological Sort
- `/original` - Original implementation using Binary Search Tree
- `narrative.md` - Detailed narrative explaining enhancements and learning outcomes

## Technical Requirements
Original Implementation:
- C++14
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- File I/O capabilities

Enhanced Version:
- C++17
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- Advanced graph algorithms library

## Key Features
- Course data management using BST
- Prerequisite relationship tracking
- Course information queries
- Advanced prerequisite validation (enhanced version)
- Cycle detection in prerequisites (enhanced version)
- Optimal course sequencing (enhanced version)

## Enhancement Overview
The enhancement focuses on two major areas:
1. Data Structure Enhancement:
   - Implementation of graph-based course relationships
   - Advanced prerequisite tracking system
   - Improved memory management
   - Optimized data access patterns

2. Algorithm Implementation:
   - Depth-First Search (DFS) for prerequisite traversal
   - Topological Sort for course sequencing
   - Cycle detection in prerequisite relationships
   - Advanced error handling for invalid relationships
