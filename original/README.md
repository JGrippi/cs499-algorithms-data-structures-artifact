# Original Implementation - Course Advisory System

## Overview
This is the original implementation of the course advisory system developed for CS-300. The project demonstrates fundamental data structure principles through a Binary Search Tree implementation for managing course data and prerequisites.

## Core Components

### Binary Search Tree Implementation
- Course node structure
- Tree traversal methods
- Search functionality
- Ordered course listing

### Course Management
- Course data storage and retrieval
- Basic prerequisite tracking
- Course information display
- File-based data loading

### User Interface
- Interactive menu system
- Course listing functionality
- Individual course lookup
- Data structure loading option

## Data Structure Design
- Binary Search Tree for efficient course lookup
- Node-based prerequisite storage
- Vector-based prerequisite list
- String-based course identifiers

## Functionality
- Load course data from file
- Display all courses in alphabetical order
- Search for specific courses
- View course prerequisites
- Basic input validation
